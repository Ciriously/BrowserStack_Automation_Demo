# El Pa√≠s Scraper & BrowserStack Automation

This project is a comprehensive demonstration of skills in web scraping, API integration, text processing, and cloud-based parallel testing.

The script automates a full workflow:

1.  **Web Scraping:** Uses Selenium to navigate to the El Pa√≠s (Spanish) opinion section and scrape the first 5 articles.
2.  **Data Extraction:** Gathers the full title, article content, and cover image (for the local test) for each article.
3.  **API Integration:** Feeds the Spanish titles into the `googletrans` API to get English translations.
4.  **Text Processing:** Analyzes the translated English titles to identify and count frequently repeated words.
5.  **Parallel Cloud Testing:** Executes the _entire_ workflow simultaneously across 5 different desktop and mobile browser configurations using BrowserStack.

## üìä Final Result: BrowserStack Dashboard

The `browserstack_test.py` script executes all 5 test environments in parallel. The Automate Dashboard provides a full video recording, text logs, and pass/fail status for each test.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup & Installation

Follow these steps to get the project running.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ciriously/BrowserStack_Automation_Demo
cd BrowserStack_Automation_Demo
```

### 2. Set Up Credentials

This project uses a `.env` file for secure credential management.

- This project uses a `.env` file for secure credential management.

- Create a new file named .env in the root of the project.

Add your BrowserStack credentials to this file:

```bash

BS_USER="YOUR_USERNAME_HERE"
BS_KEY="YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_HERE"
```

The included `.gitignore` file will prevent this file from ever being committed.

### 3. Install Dependencies

It is highly recommended to use a Python virtual environment.

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Mac/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# Install all required libraries
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

There are two scripts to run:

##### 1. `local_test.py`

This script runs the entire process on your local machine using your local Chrome browser. It's perfect for quickly debugging the scraping logic.

```bash
python local_test.py
```

##### 2. `browserstack_test.py` (Main Script)

This is the final product. It runs the full 5-thread parallel test build on the BrowserStack cloud, loading its credentials from your `.env` file.

```bash
python browserstack_test.py
```

After running, log in to your BrowserStack Automate dashboard to see the live results.
